<!--
SKILL-core.md: the body every target's SKILL.md shares, section by section.
Each target's SKILL.md carries these sections verbatim, each between the
same core:begin / core:end marker lines, in this order, and writes its own
text around them; graphos-factory-core/scripts/skill-core-check.sh fails CI when one
drifts. Edit a section here and in every SKILL.md at once. The sections
carry no relative links (one would resolve from skills/<target>/ but not
from here): they name a reference, and each SKILL.md's References links it.

## Before anything else

1. If a workspace exists, read `.factory/decisions.json` (`graphos-factory-core decisions list .`,
   including `--open` for questions still awaiting the user), `.factory/findings.json`
   (`graphos-factory-core findings list .`) and `.factory/memory.md` **in full**. Do not re-open a
   `resolved` decision unless the user asks. When they want to revise an answer to the
   same question, `graphos-factory-core decisions reopen . --id D-nnnn` clears it and puts the record
   back to `open`, then settle it again with `decisions resolve`; when the question
   itself has changed, record a new decision instead. Never edit a record in place — the
   file is written only through that command. If the workspace still carries a legacy
   `.factory/decisions.md` and no `decisions.json`, run `graphos-factory-core decisions migrate .`
   once to import it (it preserves the `D-nnnn` ids and removes the `.md`), then
   continue. A `decisions.json` from before ADR 0113 (provenance records titled `Hand
   edit codified:` or `Source patch:`, prose with no alternative) is split once with
   `graphos-factory-core decisions migrate . --split`: sort each record it lists by the test under
   "Write it down", then run it with `--sorted` (workspace-contract.md § `decisions.json`).
2. Read the target's contract (named above and under References) and
   `naming.md`. Violating them breaks the deployed render
   rather than a test: the target's `@source` and placeholder rules, and
   `{Service}_Type` / `{service}_field` with snake_case for multi-word names.
3. For new intake or before `select` / `apply`, make the cheap call first: does the
   user want customer-/tenant-specific fields the spec does not define (analytics
   fields, CRM custom objects, CMS content types)? If not, it is a generic wrapper —
   record `context_mode: generic` in `workspace.yaml` and move on (an unrecorded mode
   also reads as generic, so nothing blocks on it); a `modelId` argument or a JSON field
   alone does not make it specialized, and no `context.yaml` is needed. Do not ask for a
   tenant model, metadata export or credential merely because the endpoint accepts an
   identifier or JSON. Only if it is specialized or you are unsure, read
   `customer-context.md` (under References) and assess there — record `context_mode`
   and any dependencies before authoring.
4. Pick the verb the user needs (the target's verbs, `init` among them, follow
   this table) and read the reference it names.

## Verbs

| Verb | Read first | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| `discover` | spec-intake **or** api-discovery | build/refresh `inventory.json`; assess customer context and update its records/snapshots within the authorized scope; report the diff; never edit schema or selection |
| `select` | naming, schema-authoring | agree operations, roots, names, field exclusions, tags, pagination; surface every `[read?]` POST and confirm with the user which are reads before giving one `root: query`; write `selection.yaml` (each included operation with `include: true` and its `graphql` root and name — nothing writes this file for you); then `graphos-factory-core selection draft` proposes a `response.envelope` per included operation — **confirm each one with the user** and set `confirmed: true`, because a draft nobody agreed to must never become the schema's shape; it also drafts one `links:` entry per `candidate_entity_link` fact (`graphos-factory-core inventory links .` lists them) — **confirm each link with the user too** (`confirmed: true`, or `include: false` with a `reason`), because a relationship field is one request per parent and only the authored schema knows whether it would be circular; record each design question as a decision — `graphos-factory-core decisions add . --title T --question Q --choice id:label … [--multiple]` — and settle each with the user via `graphos-factory-core decisions resolve . --id D-nnnn --chosen id --note …`, never as loose chat messages; record what the references settle for you as a finding (`graphos-factory-core findings add . … --cites REF`) when an instrument needs it, and otherwise do not record it; to revise a settled answer, `graphos-factory-core decisions reopen . --id D-nnnn` and resolve it again. |
| `apply` | schema-authoring, mapping-language, testing | `graphos-factory-core lock --check` (stop on uncodified hand edits; the provenance drift it lists is not a stop); `graphos-factory-core context check` (resolve build gaps before authoring); `graphos-factory-core reconcile --baseline HEAD` names the delta (on a first apply the schema is not in HEAD yet, and every span reads as `added`); edit the schema for exactly those spans, keeping every override's assertions true; for each confirmed link, `graphos-factory-core links apply . --dry-run` prints the field-level `@connect` keyed by `$this` (no `@key`; no header and no argument unless the by-id root field carries a per-call credential, which it mirrors — same argument, same header or query parameter; for a nullable fk, the `isSuccess` and selection null guards, because the router still sends `GET …/` for a null parent) to paste into the host type — it refuses `circular`, `self`, `no-fk-field`, `field-exists`, `nullable-fk`, `no-host`, `no-root-field` and `target-refused` (a stale entry whose keep-or-drop decision is not resolved `keep`, ADR 0100, ADR 0113) (connectors-language § Relationship fields) and exits 1 whenever any entry is refused, even with others printed; `graphos-factory-core scaffold` drafts the case, stub and unit entry of every operation that has none (the notes say what the unit entry could not carry) — audit every placeholder, then `e2e.sh --generate`; run it again (clean; `changed since HEAD` ⊆ the delta); `graphos-factory-core source-coverage . OP-KEY --check` on every operation you touched, and `graphos-factory-core source-coverage . --check` (no OP-KEY: every selected operation, each failing one named) before `lock` — zero `unaccounted` and zero `unresolved` in both directions, and no `unaccounted` behaviour row (an optional argument's doc comment must carry the source's omission sentence, or a `behaviour` omit says why not — a finding's `not-applicable`, a decision's `editorial`, ADR 0095), is the bar (`--check` fails closed); each path you meant to leave off is recorded, not a silence: one you chose not to expose is a decision whose alternative is exposing it, `graphos-factory-core decisions add . --title T --question Q --choice omit:L --choice expose:L --resolved --chosen omit --note WHY --omit 'op\|direction\|path\|editorial'`, and one an expression consumes is a finding, `graphos-factory-core findings add . --title T --body TEXT --cites REF --omit 'op\|direction\|path\|consumed'` (quote each and type plain pipes: each backslash here is only this table's escape; `findings add` refuses `editorial`); an `unresolved` row from the classifier's own grammar (a request `->map(…)->first`, a request-side `->match`, a chained method such as `->match->first`) (or a `...` spread that is not the `disc->match(…)` abstract-type form, ADR 0058) is recorded and reported as not verified by this layer, never cleared by editing `inventory.json` (schema-authoring.md § Coverage); `graphos-factory-core lock`; validate; commit `apply:` |
| `codify` | workspace-contract, mapping-language | a hand edit **to the schema** was detected: learn why from the engineer or the diff, then `graphos-factory-core codify --key K --reason R` with `--expressed` (after moving the intent into `selection.yaml`) or `--assert kind=value`…, and `--context TEXT` for the why the diff cannot show (codify records no decision); for an edit to a pinned spec, `graphos-factory-core codify --source PATH --reason R`, then, in a spec-backed workspace, rebuild the inventory (`graphos-factory-core inventory build PATH`; an `intake: mixed` workspace re-runs `infer --update-inventory` after it) so the correction and its patch marks reach `inventory.json`, and re-run `reconcile`; commit `decide:`. `--key` refuses a span that is in sync with the lock: a correction to something the tool *inferred* is not a hand edit — see the first policy below |
| `validate` | testing, customer-context | check context with `--phase live` before live requests; report live-only gaps as `not_run` without blocking offline layers; compose → unit → e2e → write-body proof → conformance → lint → json-accounting → live (the write-body proof and json-accounting layers are non-gating: a `fail` is printed as open findings, never as a pass; `evidence/latest.json` is `contract_version: 2`); write `evidence/latest.json`; report skipped layers as skipped; a unit run with zero cases is `not_run`, never a pass; every suite with zero cases fails unless its header's first sentence cites its decision (`D-nnnn`), and a `skip: true` case fails; every selected operation is a live case or a live `exclusions:` entry with its reason; lint's `link-untested` warns on each relationship field that no unit entry targets (`<Type>.<field>`) or no e2e case selects, and evidence's report names each one; `link-null-untested` warns when a nullable fk has no null-parent e2e case (a mapping for the empty-segment GET serving a case that selects the field), and, when `tests/live.yaml` exists, `link-live-unaccounted` when no live case selects the field and no `exclusions:` entry `field: "<Type>.<field>"` names it; a field with neither unit nor e2e, with no null-parent case, or excluded live is not validated; say so (Phase 7as (c)/(d) scaffold the tests; the hand-written route is connectors-language § Relationship fields); a conformance body the oracle could not judge is `unchecked` (no documented shape) or `unmatched` (no such operation, unreadable body — this one fails), never a pass; an accepted gap is `graphos-factory-core codify --waive TARGET --status S --reason R`; before reporting, `graphos-factory-core lock --check --provenance`; when it exits 3, relock (`graphos-factory-core lock`) only when a plain `graphos-factory-core lock --check` reports no changed or unattributed span, pinned-source problem or edited inventory (it then prints the relock advice, and `--json` sets `relock_advisable`) — the drift is provenance alone (a case, a stub, a `memory.md` line), or a document `sources.lock.yaml` no longer pins, which a relock stops watching on purpose. Otherwise the schema, a pinned document or `inventory.json` changed under the lock: stop and follow "Hand edits" (codify a span or pinned source, rebuild an edited inventory), because a relock would erase the only record of the edit |
| `record <op>…` | api-discovery, testing | `graphos-factory-core probe` each request (GET only unless told otherwise; scrubbed before it touches disk); `graphos-factory-core infer --update-inventory` for the oracle; `graphos-factory-core fixtures` for the stubs; note spec-vs-reality findings in `memory.md` |

## Instruments

One binary, the product's, plus the shell wrappers in `graphos-factory-core/scripts/` around rover, Java
and curl for the validation layers. It is downloaded from the skill's GitHub releases (the rolling
`edge` pre-release until a versioned release exists) by the skill's own `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (the
SessionStart hook runs it), which also links it as `graphos-factory-core`; it is built from
`crate/` only when developing the skill itself (`bootstrap.sh --build`). Every wrapper takes
the binary from `$GRAPHOS_FACTORY_CORE_BIN`, then that link in the bootstrap cache, then PATH, prints which
one and its version to stderr, and exits **78** (a `fail`, never a skip) when it is
older than the pin (`crate/Cargo.toml`, or `$GRAPHOS_FACTORY_CORE_VERSION`); `evidence` hands the
wrappers its own binary. On 78, re-run `bootstrap.sh` (`--build` in a checkout) or set
`GRAPHOS_FACTORY_CORE_BIN` — never lower the pin to get past it. Run everything from the workspace
root. `graphos-factory-core <command> [verb] --help` (or `-h`) prints that command's usage and reads
or writes nothing (ADR 0086). A flag the verb does not declare — a typo, or two flags
quoted into one argument — is refused with exit 2 and nothing runs (ADR 0097); fix the
spelling, never drop the flag. `rover` is needed for compose, unit and e2e; Java for
e2e's WireMock; nothing is ever installed into a workspace.

```bash
S=path/to/graphos-factory-core/scripts
export GRAPHOS_FACTORY_CORE_SCRIPTS=$S                    # evidence needs to find the wrappers
# If the host supplies a model identifier, set GRAPHOS_FACTORY_CORE_LLM_MODEL to that exact value.
# Never infer or guess a model identifier. The lock records unknown when this value is absent,
# and `lock` prints a one-line warning for that and for a skill source of binary-build (ADR 0090).

`inventory list` and `describe` exist so you never read a large raw spec:
page through the inventory and expand one operation at a time. A page holds
50 operations unless `--limit` says otherwise; `operations` alone is not the
whole inventory — keep calling with `--offset <next_offset>` until
`next_offset` is null.
<!-- core:end -->

<!-- core:begin -->
## Policies you apply every time (the why is in the references)

- **Query vs Mutation is semantic, and a POST is a write until the user
  says otherwise.** The inventory records every POST as `write` and marks
  the ones whose name suggests a read with a `read_hint` (`[read?]` in
  `inventory list`). At `select`, list every hinted POST and ask the user
  which are reads before writing `root: query` for any; `selection.yaml`
  carries the explicit `graphql.root`, and a POST selected as a Query needs
  its reason recorded as a decision (the resolution of the open question
  you raised at `select`, or `graphos-factory-core decisions add . --resolved …`
  with its `query` and `mutation` choices): a write under `Query` is one
  callers, caches and retries treat as safe, so the choice has to be
  reviewable.
- **The inventory is facts; the selection is judgements.** `inventory.json` is a
  straight reading of the source: every field is checkable against the document, it is
  regenerable at any time, it is **never hand-edited**, and it never governs the schema.
  Every judgement that changes the schema or the tests — the GraphQL root, the field
  name, the response envelope, what is exposed of the pagination, tags, exclusions — is
  in `selection.yaml`, where the tool drafts it as a hint and you confirm it with the
  user. When an inference is wrong, do not correct the inventory (the lock hashes it;
  `lint` reports `unacknowledged-inventory-edit` and `inventory build` refuses to
  overwrite it): fix the **document** in the pinned working copy and `codify --source`,
  or write the **judgement** you want into `selection.yaml` and re-run `reconcile`.
  `codify --key` is for neither — it records a hand edit to the schema and refuses a
  span that is in sync.
- **A relationship link is a judgement in `links:`.** The inventory's
  `candidate_entity_link` fact only proposes; `selection draft` writes the
  entry `confirmed: false`, and an unconfirmed draft never governs — no
  field is applied, reconcile notes it, lint warns. A confirmed link is a
  field-level `@connect` keyed by `$this`, no `@key`, mirroring its by-id
  root connector's credential — none under `@source` auth (connectors-language.md
  § Relationship fields) — and, for a nullable fk, guarded so a null
  parent resolves to null instead of failing on `GET …/` (ADR 0084); the entity form is the cross-subgraph and `$batch`
  exception and needs a decision. A confirmed link whose target the
  current rules refuse or whose fact is gone is stale and raises an open
  decision for the field — choices `keep` and `drop`, the refusal as its
  context; run the `decisions add` command reconcile and lint print and
  name the record in the entry's `decision:` (ADR 0113). While it is open
  the link is reconcile drift, `link-target-refused` and a
  `target-refused` refusal from `links apply` (ADR 0100). Resolved `keep`
  exempts it (ADR 0098); resolved `drop`: set `include: false` citing the
  decision and remove only that field and its hand-written tests on the
  next apply — never regenerate.
- **Never an executable SDL default.** `pageLimit: Int = 5` is a value the router sends
  when the caller omits the argument and a consuming agent copies as "the value to use".
  Write `pageLimit: Int` and put the provider's default — with its `minimum`, `maximum`
  and `enum`, whenever the inventory carries them — in the argument's doc comment
  (schema-authoring.md § Argument
  constraints). No offline layer sees the difference. The one exception is a
  sparse-fieldsets argument (`fields: String = "…"`), whose default lint derives and
  requires (§ Sparse fieldsets). The rest of an argument's doc comment is at most one
  source sentence, opt-in per service, and never its type or requiredness (§ Argument
  descriptions).
- **Untyped beats unreachable, but typed beats untyped.** Emit a `<Prefix>_JSON` scalar
  only when the shape cannot be typed honestly (any `oneOf` at `connect/v0.3`; at v0.4
  one whose members no wire value tells apart, or that is nested where no connector of
  its own can re-fetch it; free-form objects; `additionalProperties` maps) and say why
  in a doc comment. At v0.4 a discriminated `oneOf` is a union or interface, mapped as
  `... kind->match([wire, { __typename: "Member", … }], …, [@, null])`
  (mapping-language.md § Abstract types). Never a typed guess that drops payload data.
- **An error's message path comes from the inventory's documented shape, never a guessed
  convention.** Read `errors[].shape_ref` for the operations a source's or connector's
  `errors` block covers before writing the expression (schema-authoring.md § Errors);
  `lint`'s `error-path-unresolved` checks it.
- **Every included operation gets executed evidence**: a case plus a scoped fixture, a
  unit entry when its arguments are scalars, and a conformance check against the spec or
  the inferred schema. A skipped layer is reported as skipped, never as a pass.
- **Fixtures are truth.** Never edit a recorded fixture to make a test pass — fix the
  schema, the case, or the expectation. Scrub before commit; a committed file names a
  credential's environment variable, never its value.
- **A `.factory/` file is a regular file, or nothing.** Every instrument reads and
  writes `.factory/*` through one custody module (ADR 0025): a symlink at any component
  of the path — `.factory` itself, `sources/`, the file — is refused, on read and on
  write alike, and the message names the workspace-relative path, never the link's
  target. `refused — a symlink, not a regular file` means the *workspace* is wrong, not
  the tool: restore the real file (`git checkout --` it, or copy it in) and re-run.
  Never work around it by reading or writing the target yourself.
- **Account for everything.** Every operation the API has is `selected`,
  `excluded` (with a reason), `unsupported` (with a reason), or
  `unresolved`. "What was left on the table" is the question the user is
  actually asking.
- **Write it down — one test decides where:** *could a reasonable engineer
  have gone the other way, and would the service still be valid?* (ADR 0113;
  the shapes are in workspace-contract.md)
  - Yes → `graphos-factory-core decisions add`, with the question and every
    alternative, resolved by the user or by you with `--note` saying why you
    were confident enough not to ask.
  - No, because a reference, an ADR or the wire settles it →
    `graphos-factory-core findings add --cites …`, and only when an instrument
    needs its `omits` or `affects` or the next session needs the fact.
  - A vendor quirk, a dead endpoint, an auth detail → `memory.md`. Also
    `memory.md`, under `## Tried and rejected`: a negative result, an
    accepted residual no instrument can waive, a standing correction the
    user gave — none is derivable from current state, and the next session
    reads `memory.md`, not `git log`.
  - A measurement, a correction to an earlier record, a stash, "found and
    fixed" → the commit message, or an edit to the record it corrects.
  - Something the *next service* would want → `graphos-factory-core/references/lessons.md`.

  A spec correction is none of these: edit the working copy, then
  `graphos-factory-core codify --source` records it as `patches[]` in
  `sources.lock.yaml` with the reason; add the live evidence as `verified`.

<!-- core:begin -->
## Discover, then select, then apply

`discover` never edits the schema or selection. It rebuilds the inventory,
reports added / removed / changed operations, and assesses customer context.
It may persist requirements and authorized metadata snapshots; unresolved
inputs remain visible in `context.yaml`. The user changes `selection.yaml`
(by hand, through the UI, or by asking you); only then does `apply` touch
the schema, and only for the operations the delta names.

## Hand edits: detect, codify, keep editable

`.factory/applied.lock.yaml` is the schema as you last wrote it, one hash
per span (header, each type, each root field by operation key), plus one for
each pinned document and one for `inventory.json`. Anything
that hashes differently is a **hand edit** — the engineer's or the UI's —
and `graphos-factory-core reconcile`, `lock --check` and `lint` all name it. An
edited `inventory.json` has nothing to codify: it is built, never edited, so
rebuild it and put the correction where it belongs (the pinned document, or
`selection.yaml`). Nor is a root field whose path several operations match
equally (`unattributed-span`): declare its operation in `selection.yaml`;
`lock` and `codify` refuse it (schema-authoring.md).
**Never start an `apply` while one exists**: you could not tell it from
your own delta, and "correcting" it back toward the selection is the exact
failure this skill exists to prevent.

When you find one, codify it before anything else:

1. **Learn why.** Read the `git log` of the file and the diff of the span;
   ask the engineer if the reason is not obvious. Never invent one.
2. **Prefer the selection.** If the edit is something `selection.yaml` can
   say — a tag, a rename, an exclusion, a root, a name — put it there, check
   `graphos-factory-core reconcile` shows no drift for the operation, then
   `graphos-factory-core codify --key K --reason R --expressed`. The next apply
   reproduces the edit from the selection; nothing is frozen.
3. **Otherwise assert the intent.** `graphos-factory-core codify --key K --reason R
   --assert contains=… --assert tag=…` records an override: what must stay
   true of the span, not its bytes. Write assertions for the *point* of the
   edit (the comment that explains it, the ordering, the extra argument),
   not for incidental text. `--until` says when to revisit; `--expires`
   makes reconcile say so. `--pin` (no assertions) freezes the span and is
   a last resort — lint warns on it.
4. **Commit `decide:`.** codify wrote the why onto the override (`reason`,
   and `context` from `--context TEXT` for what the diff cannot show) and
   refreshed the lock; it records no decision, and `--decision D-nnnn`
   only attaches the entry to a real one. Add a `memory.md` line when
   the reason is a vendor fact rather than a local preference.

An override does not lock an operation. When a later selection or inventory
change names an overridden span, edit it like any other, keep every
assertion true (reconcile checks them), say in the `apply:` commit which
intents you carried forward, and re-run `graphos-factory-core lock`. If a change
would make an assertion impossible, stop and ask — do not pick a side.
Read the override's `reason` and `context` before touching the span; that
is where the why lives.

**The same rules govern a pinned spec.** `graphos-factory-core sources pin
--path openapi.json` keeps the vendor's bytes untouched as
`.factory/sources/openapi.upstream.json` and acknowledges the working copy
in `applied.lock.yaml`; from then on `openapi.json` is editable exactly like
the schema. When the spec is wrong (a field the API sends as null, a missing
response, a wrong type), edit the working copy — never the upstream — and
codify it: `graphos-factory-core codify --source openapi.json --reason R`
computes the structural difference from the upstream (formatting never
counts) and records it as `patches[]` on the entry, each operation with the
reason (and `--context`, when given). `lock --check`, `reconcile` and `lint` name an
uncodified spec edit (`unacknowledged-source-edit`) and refuse an `apply`
until it is codified; a modified upstream is an error to restore, never to
codify. A newly fetched vendor document is refreshed in with
`sources refresh --path openapi.json --from FILE --reason R` (the patches
are replayed and each reported re-applied, obsolete or in conflict; a
finding records both shas and each patch's fate; the inventory is rebuilt and diffed; see
spec-intake.md), never codified as patches and never copied over the
working copy; exit 3 means a conflict whose intent you must re-apply by hand
and codify, exit 4 an interrupted write to restore with the `git checkout`
it names. Every `discover` reads the working copy, so the inventory marks the
operations a patch touches. Add `verified:` (the sample or page that proves
the vendor wrong) to a patch by hand; a patch without it is a guess.

## Finishing an `apply`

Report context readiness and any unresolved live requirements separately from
connector test results. Then report, in this order:

1. `graphos-factory-core lock --check` before you started (no hand edits);
2. operations added, changed, removed (the `graphos-factory-core reconcile` report
   before you edited, and its `clean` line after, with `changed since HEAD`
   naming only spans the delta covers);
3. every override: its assertions `ok`, its drift from the selection (the
   engineer's, reported not fixed), and whether you changed it and why;
4. the validation table from `evidence/latest.json`, naming every skipped
   or not-run layer and its reason;
5. the `graphos-factory-core lock` result, including the recorded skill revision,
   dirty state and commit hash.

The provenance record describes the authored state. The model value is
self-reported. It does not prove the model identity or the full session
history. It does not claim bit-for-bit replay.

Quote the passing tool output rather than describing it. If any selected
operation lacks executed evidence, the workspace is **not** validated — say
so plainly instead of listing the layers that did run.
