//! Every integration test, compiled as one test binary.
//!
//! Cargo builds each `tests/*.rs` file as its own executable, and each one
//! statically links the whole `service_factory` library. With 41 files that
//! was 41 links per build and ~424 MB of test executables per checkout (ADR
//! 0061). Each file is now a module here: the files and their namespaces are
//! unchanged, only the compilation unit is shared.
//!
//! Run one file's tests with `cargo test --test integration lint::`, or one
//! test with `cargo test --test integration lint::some_case`.
//!
//! A new test file goes in this directory with a `mod` line below. A file
//! placed directly in `tests/` would become a separate binary again.
//! Modules share one process, so a test must not mutate process-global state
//! (environment variables, the working directory).
